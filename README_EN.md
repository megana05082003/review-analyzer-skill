## Project Introduction

Review Analyzer Skill is an AI-driven multi-scenario review content deep analysis tool, providing flexible analysis mode options:

- **Mode 1: Gemini Enhanced Mode (Recommended)**: Call Gemini API, use [Gemini 3.1 flash] to generate insight reports, use [Gemini 3.1 pro] to generate visualization dashboards (requires API Key, incurs fees)
- **Mode 2: Claude CLI + Gemini Hybrid Mode**: Text reports use Claude Code built-in model, visualization dashboards use [Gemini 3.1 pro] (requires API Key, incurs fees)
- **Mode 3: Claude CLI Local Mode**: Use your built-in model in Claude Code for tagging, reasoning, report and dashboard generation.

To improve token usage efficiency, the default for tag mining is to use your built-in model in Claude Code.

This tool comes with 8 dimensions and 22 general-purpose tags, rigorous insight analysis report templates, and high-quality visualization dashboards, making it a powerful assistant for product optimization, competitive analysis, and market research.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Q1: What's the difference between CLI Mode and Gemini Mode?</b></summary>

**A**: **CLI Local Mode** uses your Claude Code to complete the full tagging-report-dashboard process without additional API fees. **Gemini Enhanced Mode** uses Gemini API to generate insight reports and dashboards, requiring an API Key and incurring API fees.

**Selection Advice**:
- Need quick insights → Use Claude Code CLI mode, all processes use built-in models
- Need deep analysis, willing to pay small API fees → Use Gemini Enhanced Mode, calls Gemini for report generation and visualization dashboards
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q2: Why do I need Claude CLI?</b></summary>

**A**: CLI Local Mode requires Claude CLI for AI reasoning. This is a prerequisite for using your Claude quota for deep analysis.

**Installation Method**:
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q3: How to get Gemini API Key?</b></summary>

**A**: Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to create an API Key. Gemini mode is optional; not using it doesn't affect core functionality.

**Cost Note**: Specific pricing is subject to Google's official pricing.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q4: What are the CSV file format requirements?</b></summary>

**A**: CSV files need to include the following columns (supports fuzzy matching):
- **Review Content**: 内容/评价/body/review
- **Rating**: 打分/rating/score
- **Time**: 时间/date/日期 (optional)

See `examples/reviews_sample.csv` for details
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q5: How to upgrade Python version?</b></summary>

**A**: Python 3.9.6 is no longer supported. Upgrade to Python 3.11 or higher is recommended.

**Check Environment**:
```bash
python scripts/check_environment.py
```

**Upgrade Guide**: See [Python Upgrade Guide](docs/PYTHON_UPGRADE.md)

**Quick Upgrade**:
```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install python@3.11

# Or use pyenv (recommended)
pyenv install 3.11.7
pyenv global 3.11.7
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q6: Which e-commerce platforms are supported?</b></summary>
